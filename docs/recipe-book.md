# OctaneX MCP Recipe Book

Reusable field notes from real MCP usage. Agents should read this before visual work and append concise successes, failures, partials, and pitfalls after non-trivial runs.

## Recipe entry format

- **Outcome:** `success`, `failure`, `partial`, or `pitfall`
- **Recorded:** UTC timestamp
- **Context:** what the agent/user tried to do

### Steps
- The exact operational steps that mattered.

### Signals / evidence
- Files, statuses, renders, logs, or errors that proved the outcome.

### Follow-ups
- What a future agent should try, avoid, or verify.

## Seed: prefer one-shot bridge for multi-command scenes

- **Outcome:** success
- **Recorded:** project initialization
- **Context:** Multi-command scenes can queue import/material/camera/lighting/render commands faster than the persistent Octane Lua UI can repaint.

### Steps
- Queue the full scene from a high-level MCP visual tool such as `octane_visualize_bars` or `octane_visualize_surface`.
- Run `/Users/craig/octanex-mcp/octane_lua/hermes_bridge_oneshot_v2.lua` inside Octane X.
- Check `octane_status()` for drained queue and processed command files.
- Queue `octane_save_preview(...)` only after the scene mutation batch has processed.

### Signals / evidence
- `queue/` drains.
- `processed/` gains command JSON files.
- Octane viewport can repaint after the one-shot script exits.

### Follow-ups
- If using the persistent bridge, treat status `released` after `start_render` as intentional, not a crash.
- If preview saving fails, verify the render file exists before reporting success.

## Documentation and recipe-book initialization

- **Outcome:** success
- **Recorded:** 2026-07-04 22:39 UTC
- **Context:** Repository was initialized for agent learning with examples and self-improving recipes.

### Steps
- Added README workflow cards and agent quickstart.
- Added MCP recipe-book read/write tools.
- Validated compileall and self-test.

### Signals / evidence
- uv run python -m compileall src passed before this recipe entry.
- uv run octanex-mcp --self-test queued a ping and found Octane X app.

### Follow-ups
- Run hermes mcp test octanex after Hermes reload to confirm tool discovery includes recipe tools.
